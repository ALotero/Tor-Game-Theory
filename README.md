# Tor-Game-Theory
Towards Improving Torâ€™s Resilience to Entry-Exit &amp; End-to-End Attacks  Using Game Theory


Included are 4 seperate code file(s):
  1. TorNetworkAttacker.java : Simulation utilizing Game Theory to increase an attacker's chances of owning identifying a once anonymous user (the defender).
  2. TorNetworkDefender.java : Similar to the Attacker simulation, this code uses Game Theory to decrease the attacker's success rate, in order to remain anonymous.
  3. PreliminaryCode(NotFinal).java : This was the original code being written at the time of submitting our Research proposal paper. This is a very rough, unorganized draft of the code that doesn't include many of the necessary variables. THIS IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF OUR REPORTED RESULTS.
  4. JavaObjOriented folder : contains a WORK IN PROGRESS for an java object-oriented version of the simulation code. Currently does not contain all of the necessary variables, so once again, RESULTS FROM THIS CODE DOES NET REPRESENT OUR OFFICIAL RESULTS.
