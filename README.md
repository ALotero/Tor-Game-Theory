Included are 4 seperate folders with code:

1. OfficialResultsCode/ : this folder contains our official code used to find our results;
a. TorNetworkAttacker.java : Simulation utilizing Game Theory to increase an attacker's chances of owning identifying a once anonymous user (the defender).
b. TorNetworkDefender.java : Similar to the Attacker simulation, this code uses Game Theory to decrease the attacker's success rate, in order to remain anonymous.

2. PreliminaryCode(NotFinal)/ : This folder includes the original code, Preliminary.c written in c at the time of submitting our research proposal paper. This is a very rough, unorganized draft of the code that doesn't include many of the necessary variables. THIS IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF OUR REPORTED RESULTS. 

3. JavaObjOriented/ : folder contains a WORK IN PROGRESS for a java object-oriented version of the simulation code. Currently does not contain all of the necessary variables, so once again, RESULTS FROM THIS CODE DOES NET REPRESENT OUR OFFICIAL RESULTS.
